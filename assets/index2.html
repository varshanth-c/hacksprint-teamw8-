    <h1>Descriptive Machine Learning Overview</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Supervised Learning:</h2>
        <p>This type of machine learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the algorithm learns to map input data to corresponding output labels. It's used for tasks like classification (assigning labels to input data) and regression (predicting a continuous value).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Unsupervised Learning:</h2>
        <p>In contrast, unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm explores the data without predefined output labels to discover patterns or relationships. Common techniques include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (simplifying the dataset while retaining essential information).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Descriptive Statistics:</h2>
        <p>Descriptive machine learning often utilizes descriptive statistics to summarize and present key features of a dataset. Measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation provide insights into the central tendency and variability of the data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Data Visualization:</h2>
        <p>Visualization is crucial in descriptive ML. Graphs, charts, and plots help in presenting patterns and trends effectively. Common visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Feature Engineering:</h2>
        <p>Understanding the importance of features (variables) in a dataset is essential. Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, or creating new features to enhance the model's performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h2>
        <p>EDA is a crucial step in descriptive machine learning. It involves analyzing the data, identifying patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables. Techniques like correlation analysis help understand how variables are related.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Data Preprocessing:</h2>
        <p>Cleaning and preparing the data is fundamental. This includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables to make the dataset suitable for analysis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Model Evaluation:</h2>
        <p>Even in descriptive ML, assessing the performance of models can be important. This may involve using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or other domain-specific measures depending on the nature of the task.</p>
