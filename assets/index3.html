    <h1>Python Programming Language Overview</h1>

    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Here are some key details:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Python uses a clean and easy-to-read syntax, emphasizing code readability. It uses
            indentation to define code blocks.</li>

        <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong> Python is interpreted, meaning that the code is executed line by line,
            making it easy for debugging and testing.</li>

        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Widely used in various domains such as web development, data science,
            artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more.</li>

        <li><strong>Libraries and Frameworks:</strong> Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, like NumPy
            and Pandas for data manipulation, Django and Flask for web development, TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine
            learning, and many others.</li>

        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Python has a large and active community that contributes to its growth.
            There are abundant online resources, forums, and documentation.</li>

        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Python supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms,
            providing flexibility in coding styles.</li>

        <li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong> Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare the type
            of a variable explicitly.</li>

        <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Python is compatible with major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and
            Linux, allowing code portability.</li>

        <li><strong>Version 2 vs. 3:</strong> Python 2 and Python 3 are two major versions. Python 3 is the current and
            recommended version, as Python 2 reached its end of life on January 1, 2020.</li>

        <li><strong>Development IDEs:</strong> Popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Python include
            PyCharm, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
